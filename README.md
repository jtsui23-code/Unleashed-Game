# Unleashed - Turn-Based Roguelike (Python, Pygame)

## Description

**Unleashed** is a turn-based roguelike game developed in Python using Pygame, created by **Jack Tsui**, **Zachary Barrentine**, **Zach Lewis**, **Daniel Prince**, and **Gage Ahlmark**. Originally a small prototype, the game has evolved into a more substantial collaborative project with character progression, resource upgrades, and dynamic menu-driven battles.
